It encompasses a whole lot of characteristics and traits of humanity. My father played. And my father was a coach. It was as easy as watching the NFL on Sunday, watching college football on Saturday. When I got to high school I knew that I wanted to play and I knew that I wanted to give it a shot and I did. I’ve been playing the game ever since. I was lucky enough to be able to play all over Europe. Unfortunately I had a pretty severe injury back in 2012 that sidelined me for most of the season. I took that as my sign to finally make the transition to coaching, and see what the other side was like.{breakLine}{breakLine}So being an expat is certainly fun, it’s certainly an adventure. The city is not so big, it’s quite humble. The people are quite nice, receptive, especially considering the American football team has quite a following amongst expats. We’re quite well received in the area. Managing your finances alongside that is not always the easiest. That’s where Wise has come into the picture for me.{breakLine}{breakLine}I need to use the Wise account for two main reasons. Transferring money home, as well as, because I do live internationally, for the various currencies Wise has to offer. It’s changed the game in terms of simplicity and certainly been a life saver for expat living. Looking at a higher echelon of football here in Europe, it was truly a blessing that helped me develop as a coach. People don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care. And what makes a good coach is if you indeed care. Do you care about your players? And even in the future when I’m not around, I want to know that they became good leaders, good managers, husbands, fathers. Then I know I was successful as a coach.","home.social.digital.subtitle":"Digital nomads","home.social.business.subtitle":"Businesses","home.social.business.body":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.cta.text":"Watch video","home.social.business.image.alt":"Two people smiling, with a shop in the background","home.social.business.drawer.header":"Meet the people using Wise","home.social.business.drawer.title":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.drawer.body":"We have a clothing brand that makes dungarees, and we use Wise to pay for all those dungarees. Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive. It was ridiculous how good the Wise exchange rate was. Wise was always bang on the Google rate. I could put in how much I want to pay in GBP or how much I want to send in INR and it just calculates the opposite direction, tells you straight away what exchange rate you're getting, what fees you're paying. In a few clicks it was done and the money's in an Indian bank account. We wouldn't be as responsive to our customers if the money wasn't able to be transferred as quickly as well. Using Wise to make international payments is faster than anything else.

It encompasses a whole lot of characteristics and traits of humanity. My father played. And my father was a coach. It was as easy as watching the NFL on Sunday, watching college football on Saturday. When I got to high school I knew that I wanted to play and I knew that I wanted to give it a shot and I did. I’ve been playing the game ever since. I was lucky enough to be able to play all over Europe. Unfortunately I had a pretty severe injury back in 2012 that sidelined me for most of the season. I took that as my sign to finally make the transition to coaching, and see what the other side was like.{breakLine}{breakLine}So being an expat is certainly fun, it’s certainly an adventure. The city is not so big, it’s quite humble. The people are quite nice, receptive, especially considering the American football team has quite a following amongst expats. We’re quite well received in the area. Managing your finances alongside that is not always the easiest. That’s where Wise has come into the picture for me.{breakLine}{breakLine}I need to use the Wise account for two main reasons. Transferring money home, as well as, because I do live internationally, for the various currencies Wise has to offer. It’s changed the game in terms of simplicity and certainly been a life saver for expat living. Looking at a higher echelon of football here in Europe, it was truly a blessing that helped me develop as a coach. People don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care. And what makes a good coach is if you indeed care. Do you care about your players? And even in the future when I’m not around, I want to know that they became good leaders, good managers, husbands, fathers. Then I know I was successful as a coach.","home.social.digital.subtitle":"Digital nomads","home.social.business.subtitle":"Businesses","home.social.business.body":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.cta.text":"Watch video","home.social.business.image.alt":"Two people smiling, with a shop in the background","home.social.business.drawer.header":"Meet the people using Wise","home.social.business.drawer.title":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.drawer.body":"We have a clothing brand that makes dungarees, and we use Wise to pay for all those dungarees.

It encompasses a whole lot of characteristics and traits of humanity. My father played. And my father was a coach. It was as easy as watching the NFL on Sunday, watching college football on Saturday. When I got to high school I knew that I wanted to play and I knew that I wanted to give it a shot and I did. I’ve been playing the game ever since. I was lucky enough to be able to play all over Europe. Unfortunately I had a pretty severe injury back in 2012 that sidelined me for most of the season. I took that as my sign to finally make the transition to coaching, and see what the other side was like.{breakLine}{breakLine}So being an expat is certainly fun, it’s certainly an adventure. The city is not so big, it’s quite humble. The people are quite nice, receptive, especially considering the American football team has quite a following amongst expats. We’re quite well received in the area. Managing your finances alongside that is not always the easiest. That’s where Wise has come into the picture for me.{breakLine}{breakLine}I need to use the Wise account for two main reasons. Transferring money home, as well as, because I do live internationally, for the various currencies Wise has to offer. It’s changed the game in terms of simplicity and certainly been a life saver for expat living. Looking at a higher echelon of football here in Europe, it was truly a blessing that helped me develop as a coach. People don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care. And what makes a good coach is if you indeed care. Do you care about your players? And even in the future when I’m not around, I want to know that they became good leaders, good managers, husbands, fathers. Then I know I was successful as a coach.","home.social.digital.subtitle":"Digital nomads","home.social.business.subtitle":"Businesses","home.social.business.body":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.cta.text":"Watch video","home.social.business.image.alt":"Two people smiling, with a shop in the background","home.social.business.drawer.header":"Meet the people using Wise","home.social.business.drawer.title":"Getting money across borders before Wise was ridiculously difficult and expensive.","home.social.business.drawer.body":"We have a clothing brand that makes dungarees, and we use Wise to pay for all those dungarees.
